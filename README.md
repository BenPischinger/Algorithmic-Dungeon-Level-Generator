# Algorithmic-Dungeon-Level-Generator
Bachelor Project

After setting up the Project in Unity 2019, you can use the scenes in the scene folder to test out the scripts.

To generate a whole dungeon, use the "DungeonMain" scene. 

Since the dungeon can be quite the labyrinth I advice you to explore via the scene viewer, instead of the in-game character controller.

The grid for spawns can be turned off in the gridController script, line 56, by setting gameObject.SetActive(false);
