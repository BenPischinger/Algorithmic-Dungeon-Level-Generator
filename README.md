# Algorithmic-Dungeon-Level-Generator

A Unity project that was developed for my Bachelor Thesis.

The goal was to create a procedural generation prototype that can generate a dungeon crawler level and fill it up with enemies, traps and items based on the user's input.

Rooms for the dungeon are saved in their own scenes and then placed by a script.

Additional content can easily be added by creating new scenes with different kinds of rooms or enviroement.

Same goes for monsters, traps and items by adding additional ones to the existing spawners.
