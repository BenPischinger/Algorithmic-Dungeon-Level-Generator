# Algorithmic-Dungeon-Level-Generator
Bachelor Project

After setting up the Project in Unity 2019, you can use the scenes in the scene folder to test out the scripts.

To generate a whole dungeon, use the "DungeonMain" scene. 

There is currently no player controller implemented, so the dungeon has to be navigated in the scene view.
